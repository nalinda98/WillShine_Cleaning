                      When it comes to keeping spaces clean and healthy, not all
                      cleaning jobs are the same. Office cleaning and
                      residential cleaning may seem similar at first glance, but
                      they are actually two very different services, each with
                      its own unique requirements, challenges, and goals.
                      Understanding the differences can help you choose the
                      right service for your needs — whether you’re managing a
                      busy office or maintaining a home.

                      1. Purpose and Priorities
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                      <strong>Office Cleaning:</strong> Focuses on maintaining a
                      professional, healthy environment for employees, clients,
                      and visitors. It targets high-traffic areas and shared
                      spaces like desks, conference rooms, kitchens, and
                      restrooms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <strong>Residential Cleaning:</strong> Centers around
                      comfort and lifestyle, with more attention to personal
                      items, furniture, bedrooms, and personalized details.
                    </p>

                      2. Cleaning Equipment and Products
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                      <strong>Office Cleaning:</strong> Uses commercial-grade
                      equipment for efficiency, such as large vacuums, floor
                      polishers, eco-friendly disinfectants, and specialized
                      carpet cleaners.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <strong>Residential Cleaning:</strong> Involves lighter,
                      more delicate products to protect furnishings, often
                      accommodating preferences for natural or specific cleaning
                      brands.

                    <p>
                      <strong>Office Cleaning:</strong> Typically performed
                      daily or weekly due to high foot traffic, often scheduled
                      after business hours to minimize disruption.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <strong>Residential Cleaning:</strong> Usually weekly,
                      bi-weekly, or monthly depending on the homeowner's
                      lifestyle and preferences, with more flexible scheduling.

                    </h3>
                    <p>
                      In an office, the focus is on speed, efficiency, and
                      sanitization — it’s about creating a safe, productive
                      environment. In a home, it’s more personal: attention to
                      detail, organization, and comfort are often key.
                    </p>
