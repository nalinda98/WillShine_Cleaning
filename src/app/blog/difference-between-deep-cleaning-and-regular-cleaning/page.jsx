                      Regular vs Deep Office Cleaning: What’s the Difference?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                      When it comes to keeping your workplace clean, not all
                      cleaning is created equal. While regular office cleaning
                      is essential for day-to-day hygiene, deep cleaning goes
                      several steps further, targeting areas that often get
                      overlooked. At WillShine Cleaning, we offer both regular
                      and deep cleaning services to meet the unique needs of
                      Perth businesses. Here’s what sets them apart—and why both
                      are important.

                      🧼 What Is Regular Office Cleaning?
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                      Regular office cleaning refers to the routine maintenance
                      of your workspace to ensure it remains neat, sanitary, and
                      presentable. This is usually done daily or several times a
                      week.
                    </p>

                      🧽 What Is Deep Cleaning?
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                      Deep cleaning is a more intensive process that reaches
                      hidden, hard-to-reach, or neglected areas that regular
                      cleaning often misses. It’s a top-to-bottom refresh of
                      your entire workplace.
